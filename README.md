skivr
=====

Skivr is an ajax lazy loader for external content. It helps to keep the inital page weight low on mobile devices until a media query evaluates to true and then it grabs the content and injects it into the page.

See more documentation and a demo example [here](http://mooklateer.github.io/skivr/)
